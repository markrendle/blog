I'll preface that .NET is amazing and I love it, especially Core becoming super fast and truly multi-platform. But Roslyn? It's huge, klunky, unwieldy, and poorly documented. Maybe it's easy for an expert, but it's harrrrd to become an expert. Every time I use it I run into serious roadblocks which just shouldn't be there. The latest frustration with it, whose search for solution brought me here, is this simple case: Load a solution (with MSBuildWorkspace), walk the projects, and obtain paths to their project references. Simple right? The path is there in the ProjectId, but some designer thought, \"No one needs this but us; make that internal.\" Now I have to access an internal feature via reflection. This, and so many other things with Roslyn, just shouldn't be that hard.","date":"2022-05-12T19:30:05.081Z"}
